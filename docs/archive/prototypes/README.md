# TUI Navigation Prototype 🧭

**Status:** ✅ Prototype Complete
**Created:** 2025-12-11
**Purpose:** Add browser-like navigation to claude-ctx TUI using Textual's native command palette

---

## 🎯 What This Prototype Does

Enhances TUI navigation with:

1. **Back/Forward Navigation** - Browser-like history (Backspace/Arrow keys)
2. **Navigation Stack** - Track last 50 viewed screens
3. **Native Command Palette** - Use Textual's built-in command system
4. **Cross-View Search** - Jump to any agent/skill/workflow from anywhere
5. **Recent Views** - Quick access to recently visited screens

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Apply the Patch

Open `claude_ctx_py/tui/main.py` and apply changes from `main_py_navigation_patch.py`:

```bash
# Follow the 8 sections in main_py_navigation_patch.py:
# 1. Add imports (line ~138)
# 2. Register providers (line ~325)
# 3. Add navigation state (line ~327)
# 4. Add keybindings (line ~250-320)
# 5. Update watch_current_view (line ~500)
# 6. Add navigation methods (line ~4000+)
# 7. Add keybinding actions (line ~4000+)
# 8. Initialize stack in on_mount (line ~412)
```

### Step 2: Test It

```bash
# Run the TUI
claude-ctx tui

# Test navigation:
# 1. Press 2 (agents) → 5 (skills) → 6 (workflows)
# 2. Press Backspace → Back to skills
# 3. Press Backspace → Back to agents
# 4. Press → → Forward to skills
# 5. Press → → Forward to workflows

# Test command palette:
# 1. Press Ctrl+P
# 2. Type "back" → See back command
# 3. Type "agent" → See all agents
# 4. Type "recent" → See recent views
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

Run through the testing checklist in `main_py_navigation_patch.py` (bottom of file).

## 🎨 User Experience Changes

### Before (Current)
```
User navigates: Agents (2) → Skills (5) → Workflows (6)
❌ No way to go back except pressing view number again
❌ Lost in navigation - what was I just looking at?
❌ Have to remember which view something was in
❌ Search only works within current view
```

### After (With Prototype)
```
User navigates: Agents (2) → Skills (5) → Workflows (6)
✅ Press Backspace → Back to Skills
✅ Press Backspace → Back to Agents
✅ Press → → Forward to Skills
✅ Ctrl+P → Type "recent" → See recent views
✅ Ctrl+P → Type agent name → Jump directly to it
✅ Navigation feels like a browser!
```

## 🔄 Migration Options

### Option A: Native Only (Recommended)
- Remove custom `action_command_palette()`
- Ctrl+P opens native palette automatically
- Users get all navigation features
- Simplest integration

### Option B: Side-by-Side
- Keep custom palette (Ctrl+P)
- Add native palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- Users can compare both
- Safe migration path

### Option C: Enhanced Custom
- Keep custom palette
- Add navigation commands to `DEFAULT_COMMANDS`
- Don't use providers
- More maintenance required

## ✅ Testing Checklist

After implementing, verify:

- [ ] Press Ctrl+P opens command palette
- [ ] Search "back" shows back command (if history exists)
- [ ] Navigate 2→5→6, press Backspace → goes to 5
- [ ] Press → goes forward to 6
- [ ] Search "agent" shows agents view + individual agents
- [ ] Search "recent" shows recently visited views
- [ ] Search agent/skill name jumps to it when selected
- [ ] Navigation stack limited to 50 entries
- [ ] Backspace doesn't conflict with text input
- [ ] Arrow keys don't conflict with flags navigation
- [ ] All 19 views accessible via command palette

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **View State Preservation**
   - Cursor/scroll position not preserved (future enhancement)
   - Separate feature, can be added later

2. **Keybinding Conflicts**
   - Left/Right arrows disabled in flags view (intentional)
   - Backspace navigation takes priority (can be adjusted)

3. **Custom Palette Styling**
   - Native palette uses Textual's default theme
   - Less customizable than custom palette
   - Trade-off for built-in features

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (For Testing)
1. Apply patch to `main.py`
2. Test navigation with Ctrl+P
3. Verify no regressions in existing views

### Short-Term (Phase 2)
1. Add view state persistence (cursor/scroll)
2. Add related items navigation (jump from agent → workflows)
3. Enhanced search with filters

### Long-Term (Phase 3)
1. Keyboard shortcuts for common navigations
2. Breadcrumb trail in status bar
3. Navigation analytics (most visited views)

## 🤝 Questions?

**Q: Will this break my existing TUI setup?**
A: No! All changes are additive. Existing keybindings still work.

**Q: Can I keep the custom palette?**
A: Yes! Use Option B (side-by-side) for gradual migration.

**Q: What if I don't like the native palette?**
A: Use Option C - add navigation to custom palette without providers.

**Q: How do I customize the native palette appearance?**
A: Limited customization via Textual CSS. For full control, keep custom palette.

**Q: Can I add more providers?**
A: Yes! Create new classes inheriting from `Provider`, add to `COMMANDS`.
